Hello, my name is <strong>John Tran</strong> and I am attending Centennial College for Software Engineering Technician.
I used to live in Toronto, but now I live in Windsor, ON. I have worked as a broker in the Property & Casualty insurance
for 5 years now. The insurance industry is quickly transitioning towards technology for their business operations. They
are relying heavily on technology to generate the algorithm they need. My goal is to become Software Developer for a
tech firm, a gaming company, or perhaps for the automotive industry.
